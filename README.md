  This repo contains the pacman exercise from my MIT Full Stack development course.
  
  ## Description
  Create some Pacmans and have them bounce around. This exercise targets a few skills building
  - Dynamically create HTML elements
  - Moving elements around based on direction and velocity
  - Detection of boundaries for direction changes
  - Manage an update loop

  ## Roadmap
  There are many upgrades possible for this project. Here's a few on my mind:
  - Collision detection among pacmans
  - Add Transform rotation to the pacman element to point in the direction it's heading
  - Big eat small system
  - Wall collision animation
